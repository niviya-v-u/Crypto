# ciphers
1. Caesar Cipher:
Shift each letter by a fixed number of places.
Example: Shift "A" by 3 becomes "D".
2. Atbash Cipher:
Substitute each letter with its reverse in the alphabet.
Example: "A" becomes "Z", "B" becomes "Y".
3. August Cipher:
This isn't a standard cipher. Can you clarify or specify the intent behind this cipher?
4. Affine Cipher:
A substitution cipher using mathematical formulas: 
E(x)=(a⋅x+b)mod m.
Requires modular arithmetic and key values a and b.
5. Vigenère Cipher:
A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a key to shift letters.
Example: Key "KEY" for plaintext "HELLO" shifts each letter cyclically based on the key.
6. Gronsfeld Cipher:
Similar to Vigenère but uses digits instead of letters for shifts.
7. Beaufort Cipher:
Similar to Vigenère but performs subtraction instead of addition for shifts.
8. Autoclave/Running Key Cipher:
Uses plaintext or a secondary key as a dynamic key for encryption.
9. N-gram Operations:
Analyze sequences of n letters for frequency analysis or cryptanalysis.
10. Hill Cipher:
A polygraphic substitution cipher using matrix multiplication over a modulus.
11. Rail Fence Cipher:
A transposition cipher arranging plaintext in zigzag patterns.
12. Route Cipher:
Transposition cipher arranging text into a grid and reading it in a defined route.
13. Myszkowski Cipher:
A transposition cipher using a key to determine columnar rearrangements.
